Make sure to not trip on my possesions on your way in! These are probably worth more than whatever you’re getting paid from the King. May your cure help me get better fast so you can get off of my property!", "Ahem, It’s you. Come in. So, what’s for today? I hope this one cures me for sure. Well, even if it doesn’t, i’m content either way I guess.", "Oh fair doctor, it is you again. How am I fairing? Well,  I’m not sure if my condition has had improvement. Let’s see what you give to me this time and hopefully it does bless me.", "Ahem, It’s you. Come in. So, what’s for today? I hope this one cures me for sure. Well, even if it doesn’t, i’m content either way I guess.", "Come in to my home. Not that it’s my concern, but have you eaten as of today? I must hope that you are taking care of your health as well of that of everyone else. If you do request, I have some “leftover” food in the dining hall I saved for you doctor, if you would like to dine. Make sure to eat up before you look after me.", "Doctor. You’re not falling to the illness, right? Good. I have been watching the town from my balcony, wondering of the others in the town and how they are. The blacksmith.. He did not look well. As did the tailor.. They were such good friends, maybe even lovers, but that is of no concern to me. Although what a shame. I’ve always wanted to get to be aquainted-. Nevermind. Do your usual cure, if you please.", "Come in, Doctor. How are the other townspeople doing? Oh… hmm.. That’s.. A great shame Doctor. I wanted give you thank-. No. It’s nothing never thou mind. Keep doing what you were doing. Today seems like a good day, the light of Mars shined through my window, I thought about my farmhand that had passed, he was so young and kind.. Forgive my ramblings, I hope whatever this is works on me."]
        , 'cured': "Oh blessed doctor! Thank you for your visits, I had once been sick of the heart, sad and lone. But I am thankful to you for having giving me what you have. I am cured and am now ready to live once more. I think I may talk to the blacksmith, or the tailor, once they have become cured of course. I have left you a sprig of <strong>Barberry</strong> in your bag.",

I also had a daughter but… she passed a few days ago because of this plague... <br> Could you give me one of your remedies. Stranged spots have been appearing on my legs.. I think they’re making it hard for me to walk. I can barely stand..", "Good morning, doctor. I sent Bertolt to Gianni’s home. Being with me won’t do any good for him. I can’t lose another child from my selfish hands... Sorry for all that. If you don’t mind… If something were to happen, could you drop by Gianni’s house and tell Bertolt I love him very much? Thank you. Oh, I would do anything to not leave him this early.", "Come in, doctor. I was simply watching over the bowl Bertolt once made with me. It sits with my others, but worth two times in my heart. I miss those days where'st I could work on pottery all day.. I can barely sit up now. I’ll try my best to fight this sickness off and hopefully go back to making my wares!", "Hello, doctor. Are you well? That’s great to hear. Me? Well, not sure if i’m better to be honest with you. But surely your treatment will help me feel better soon! Could you say hi to Bertolt and Gianni when you leave, please?", "Hello, doctor. I’ve been in bed all morning. Gianni briefly dropped by to tell me that Bertolt is doing well, and that he was sorry he could not be here longer with me. I owe Gianni a lot, he once saved me; before my children were born I thought that I would never find purpose. While'st lost in those thoughts, I was given purpose by the husband of a friend who, granted me be a mother, although It was not what I had wanted. Gianni came in to my life after I had birthed my children, at first a customer who cared for me, valued me, and provided so much.. Parden my ramblings Gianni would be a great father for Beltolt. Anyways, yes please tend to me, doctor. ", "Sorry for the delay, doctor. I’m feeling so exhausted these days so it’s very hard for me to even get out of my bed. I don’t like how this sickness made me so lazy! Oh did you meet Bertolt on the way here? You didn’t tell him how I’m doing, right? Okay, thank you. I really don’t want him to know how bad my condition is.. He watched as his sister was slowly taken from him, I dare not wish for him to see me in that state.", "It’s you, doctor. Please come in. I was thinking and praying all night. I’m not sure if I could be saved. At least I’ll get to see my beautiful daughter when I pass.. No, you’re right. Gianni and Bertolt are still alive and I need to stay beside them. I should not be thinking in that manor."]
        , 'cured': "Doctor! I owe you my life and in that I know I will never be able to repay. My son will have his mother back at last, and I can finally be with Gianni. I know it is not much to offer but I would like to give you a charm my son made, he calls it his <strong>Wooden Fish Charm.</strong>",

Could you make me feel better fast so I can go play with Lisabetta? I will be a good boy and use whatever you give me!", "Hello doctor! I was waiting for you. You’re the only person I can play with for a long time these days. Would you continue reading me the storybook after I take my medicine? ", "My fingers and toes started to hurt last night. I asked mother and father if Lisabetta could come play again, and they said no.. They said Lisabetta went to another town to see her grandparents in the sky far away. How do you go to the sky? I even saw Lisabetta’s parents walking by the window this morning, they did not go with her! I hope she is playing with her grandparents.", "Doctor, Mommy said if I meet God I should be a good boy. But would he get angry that I haven’t done great things in my life? I cry a lot, do not listen to my mom, and forgot to feed the hens.. I’m scared! Maybe if I bake a bread for him, God will like me.. If only my dad will allow me to bake some with him.", "Hello doctor! I was waiting for you. You’re the only person I can play with for a long time these days. Would you continue reading me the storybook after I take my medicine? ", "Hi doctor, do you hear it too? I hear lots of people crying. I wonder what happened, everyday I hear it, I want to help but I do not know how. I wanted to get up and look but I can not! My body feel so heavy, like someone put a giant wheat bread dough on me. I wish mother and father would come to my room more often to talk and play..", "Oh, doctor! You scared me. I took a nap. I take too much nap these days.. but when I am not sleeping, I am stuck in bed and most of the time my body hurts a lot.. Doctor, after you give me the medicine, could you read me that book over there? It’s about a brave knight saving his city from the evil dragon. It’s my favorite! When I get better, I’ll help you beat the sickness away from this town with bread and flowers! ", "Doctor! Shh look here! Don't say to my mother or father but I sneaked in some of the ingredients from my father’s bakery. I’ll bake my very first bread when my parents are away. I will make sure to bake some for you too doctor! Don’t tell my parents but, I feel like I will be seeing God very soon doctor.. I want to prove him that I wasn’t a bad boy. So maybe if I bake delicious bread for you and my mother and father and God, he will let me go to heaven!"]

Surely other townspeople would need your assistance more than I do. Well, since you’re here already, could you look over my fingers? They have been developing these weird.. Bruises. I also feel very feverish these days. I thought it was because of my old age, but perhaps it has something to do with the epidemic after all..", "Come in, doctor! I’ve been waiting. After you’re done taking care of me, would you stay for few minutes to have a chat with this old lady? We can talk about anything. If you’d like to learn some stitching techniques -which I assume you do since you’re a doctor!- I can teach you some tricks too.", "Good afternoon, doctor. Could you help me close down my tailor’s shop? I would love to keep it open but now that people barely come out of their homes and I myself cannot work for long period of time.. I’m afraid I should clean everything up until the disease clears. It took me more than 5 full moons to make these blankets. They’re the best quality quilts in town! And these velvet ribbons, too..", "Hello, doctor! Are you well? That’s great to hear. I’ve had fair slices of life and it was a truly beautiful and passionate life too. I hope younger people in town -including you, although I am not so sure of your age!- would experience something like I have. Oh, I truly hope the disease won’t take their lives away so quickly.. ", "Come in, doctor! I’ve been waiting. After you’re done taking care of me, would you stay for few minutes to have a chat with this old lady? We can talk about anything. If you’d like to learn some stitching techniques -which I assume you do since you’re a doctor!- I can teach you some tricks too. ", "Afternoon, doctor. I’ve had 4 different types of mushrooms for breakfast. I wonder if they’d help this annoying fever! My fingers seem to be okay even though the bruise has spread a bit further, but I can’t concentrate in stitching when I have fever. I’ve also added few more prayer verses to my daily prayer routine, requesting God to look over me and the townspeople… I hope he can hear me.", " Come on in. I was trying to journal all my tailoring knowledge. So when I pass, my assistant can take over my work and hopefully continue the business. I have great pride in what I do and have done, so I sincerely hope someone would care enough to carry them on for me! Since I have no direct family on this land anymore. Oh, your help would be great. Could you illustrate some stitching techniques for me? I’ll try to explain it as well as possible!", " Grim day, doctor. I heard the farmer’s wife passed away today. Rosalind was my dear friend.. This is the headscarf I made for her. She wore it almost every day. Her husband looked so exhausted from having to bury so many of his loved ones… 4 children, and now his wife.. Doctor, could you do me a favor? When I pass, would you bury my body with this headscarf? So I can bring it to Rosalind."]
        , 'cured': "Thank you doctor, you have given me some more time which I will use to teach someone my skills and pass down my fabrics. I am excited to get to spend more time here with others and although my body is old and wrinkled I am going to continue trying to inspire others. Here have this <strong>White Champignon.</strong> It is one of my favourite mushrooms."
